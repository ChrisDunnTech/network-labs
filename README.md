# Network Labs

Practical labs I’m using to sharpen CCNA‑level networking and automation skills.

| Folder | Lab topic | Tools | Key takeaways |
|--------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| `packet-tracer/basic-switching` | VLANs, trunking, inter‑VLAN routing | Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x | Achieved L2 isolation & L3 connectivity across 3 VLANs |
| `wireshark/dhcp-analysis` | DHCP discover‑offer‑request‑ack flow | Wireshark | Verified correct lease times and option fields |
| `automation/ansible-backup` | Nightly switch‑config backup | Ansible, Netmiko | Reduced manual backup time from 30 min to 5 min |

> More labs added weekly. Screenshots are in each folder’s `README.md`.
